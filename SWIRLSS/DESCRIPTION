Title: Sample Size Calculation for Assessing Predictive Biomarker Clinical Utility
Description: This package is used to calculate the sample size n so that the 95\% 
           CI mean width of the parameter proposed by Janes et. al (2014) is less than the user 
           defined length. All the functions in this package include explanation on how and when 
           to use them. SWIRLSS is an acronym for Squared Width Inversion Regression Linear.
